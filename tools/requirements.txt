# Claude Code Windows Installer Requirements
# 
# This installer uses only Python standard library modules
# No external dependencies required!
#
# The installer requires Python 3.6+ and uses these built-in modules:
# - os, sys, subprocess (system interaction)
# - pathlib (path handling)
# - winreg (Windows registry access)
# - ctypes (Windows API access)
# - logging (comprehensive logging)
# - argparse (command line arguments)
# - json (configuration handling)
#
# To install Python (if not already installed):
# 1. Download from https://python.org
# 2. Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
# 3. Verify installation: python --version
#
# No pip install needed - everything is built-in! ðŸŽ‰
